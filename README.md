The "C# Advanced" module provides an opportunity to study the .NET platform and the C# language in various aspects.
The focus is on enhancing algorithmic thinking and studying the principles of object-oriented programming.
The knowledge provided by the module includes working with linear data structures and their implementation in C#, working with streams, files, and directories, creating template classes, software testing, and software development design patterns.
As a result of the acquired knowledge, by the end of the module, participants will be able to build large projects, navigate through them, test them, applying popular methodologies, and good coding practices.
